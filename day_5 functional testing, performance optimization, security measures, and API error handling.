Testing, Error Handling & Backend Refinement

Key Areas of Focus:

Functional Testing: Validate core functionalities like product listing, cart operations, and checkout.

Error Handling: Implement proper error messages for network failures, invalid data, and unexpected errors.

Performance Optimization: Use tools like Lighthouse to improve page load times.

Cross-Browser Testing: Ensure compatibility across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

Security Testing: Validate API security, prevent injection attacks, and secure API keys.

User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Simulate real-world usage and refine UX.

Documentation Updates: Record test cases, fixes, and optimizations.

Testing Tools & Methods:

Postman: API testing.

React Testing Library: Component-level testing.


Example Error Handling Code:

try {
  const data = await fetchProducts();
  setProducts(data);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Failed to fetch products:", error);
  setError("Unable to load products. Please try again later.");
}
